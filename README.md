Naming their child has always played an important role for parents. There is a controversial belief that a name can influence a child's future, however there are other social contexts that play a strong role in personal development and success.

Quantitative sociological point of view, cultural traits and changes

## Datasets & limitations

This analysis focuses on historical data of given names in the USA, obtained from the US Social security administration. A large dataset with over 6 million records was obtained, that encompasses over 100 years of historical data (1920-2021). 

The challenge was to work with few columns that seemingly don't provide much information, and extract meaningful insights, as a basis for the final objective.

Initial columns from the dataset: (insert table)

Secondly, information on music top charts was obtained from several tables, for a posterior parallel analysis.

## Objective

The main objective was to create a name recommendation prototype, based on selected parameters, including personal music preference.

understand name popularity evolution throughout the years
how does naming change according to ethnicity and state throughout the years
suggest names, according to parameters chosen:
sex
length (short/long)
first letter
traditional/modern (year)
popular/unpopular (sum of count)
connect with a song ?
- did some popular song, celebrity or event influence naming trends in certain years? Look for peaks.


## Methods

### 1. Cleaning the datatset + EDA | Python

Insert a final clean table screenshot, with all the columns.

### 2. Joining tables and querying | SQL
